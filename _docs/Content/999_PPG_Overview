## Polarised Training

This involves 
- training 80% at a relatively slow rate  (to improve Aerobic endurance) 
- training 20% at high intensity to increase speed and strength

The mid ground  is not  trained as it does not improve either endurance or speed at all well. 

Monday nights will be Speed/Strengthg training with skills also trained.
