## Site: Lochwinnoch
**Summary**
- Lochwinnoch is our base location and all activities run from the clubs compound.
- Wind is the most common risk that will cancel sessions
- Other users are a constant dynamic risk that will need assessed on the day.

### Surface
- North Easterly (NE) winds can create meaningful Wind Chop waves that will cause beginners difficulty.
- South Westerly (SW) winds can create smaller Wind Chop waves that can usually be Knee Paddled through quite quickly to find a sheltered bit of water.
The physical surface of the Loch contains numerous
- Marker Buoys
- Sunken Logs/Trees
- Fishing Lines, lures and hooks
- Lilly pads and reed beds
- Shallow areas ( near shore and the River Calder's mouth)
- Other floating debris that may have been washed into the loch or abandoned by other water users

### Weather
- Lochwinnoch is not tidal but is open to wind.
- Winds are usually SW or NE which either blow UP or DOWN the length of the loch.
- We should operating ideally at 8kts or less with a hard maximum of 15kts.
- When the wind is South Westerly the best are to perate is at the SW end of teh Loch. This is nearest the Annexe and Largs road. It offers shelter but is exposed until you reach it. Hugging the shore offers some protection en-route.
- When the wind is North Easterly the best operating area is BlackDitch Bay. This offers some protection but is Very Exposed to eind en-route.  
- When assessing wind, it is likely that a lighter NE wind will cancel a session, 10kts or above, than would be the case with a SW wind.
