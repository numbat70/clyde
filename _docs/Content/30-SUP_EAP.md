## EAP Lochwinnoch
**Summary**
```
- Lochwinnoch has a path running along half of it's north-western shore, (where we teach)
- This acts as a Safe Haven for getting people off the water and transported back to the road access (car park or compound).

- Most first aid is better delivered ashore due to how quickly we can get people safely off the water.
BUT
- Assesment may dictate that life saving measures such as CPR need to be performed on the water.
```

The EAP contains contact details as well as Location details (described and annotated using **What3Words**)
