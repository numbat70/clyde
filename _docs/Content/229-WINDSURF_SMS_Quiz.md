## SMS Validation quiz

Every 6 months the quiz will be changed and all instructors will need to get a 100% score to be validated.

The test can be retaken until this score is reached. By this time the SMS should have been referenced several times if not fully known already.

**The quiz scores are held alongside the Incident, Kit and Learning Logs**

Use the [SMS Quiz](https://forms.gle/1Sieo5y6GY4HtBd89) to validate every 6 months
