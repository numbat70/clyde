**An example of adding in new Categories**

When you add a post into the **docs>Content** folder it is mostly in  Markdown Format.

At the top of the post though, are a couple of variables in the **Front Matter** section that is between the triple dash lines

```
- - -
title: New Categories
category: HowTo
order: 1
- - -
```

- **title** is the title (simple enough)
- **category** is the category that you see posts, in the left menu, subdivided into
- **order** is the order the post should display within the category. 1 is top

When creating new posts allways remember to follow the naming Format
- **yyyy-mm-dd-title.md**


```
**2020-12-30-title_of_the_post.md**
```
