## Types of Risk
- Generic (always the same)
- Site Specific (specific to the location)
- Dynamic (need to be assessed on the day and continuously during the activity)

and these can be
- Qualitative (Enough, Too much etc...)
- Quantitative (Numbers, limits etc...)

## Risk - Generic

Hazard | Who | Severity & Consequences (Potential) | ControlMeasure
--- | --- | --- | ---
Slip on Waterside environment | All | Bruises and broken bones up to concussion and neck injury | Educate participants about slip hazard and mandate suitable footwear or bare feet
  |  |  |  
  |  |  |  

## Risks - Lochwinnoch (Castle Semple Loch: Main Site)
The Loch is quite a safe environment with most risks coming from shore hazards, wind and other water users.

Hazard | Who | Severity & Consequences (Potential) | ControlMeasure
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Surface** Access road has stones that may injure soles of feet.  | All | Bruised feet. | Educate and recommend footwear to avoid injury
**Surface** Floating Marker Buoys, Logs, vegetation and Fishing lines may all cause collision/entanglement hazards.  | All water users | Falling from board or leash entanglement |  Educate water users but also use zoning to minimise time near known hazards
**Surface** Pontoons | ALl |  Bruises and broken bones up to concussion and neck injury  |  Educate around how slippy the pontoons can be when wet and covered in bird droppings. Ban running on them. Educate about concussion hazard if standing on board within two board lengths of teh pontoons. Mandate kneeling within this distance.
**Surface** Wooden loch siding  | All |  Bruises and broken bones up to concussion and neck injury   |  Educate around how VERY slippy the wood is along the lochside path at the car park. Mandate kneeling within two board lengths of the lochside
**Surface** Submerged lochside path | All Water Users |  Bruises and broken bones up to concussion and neck injury  |  Educate water users that the path is often submerged an d forms a submerged trip hazard. Mandate they are kneeling if within two board lengths of the **normal** lochside. Educate as to where this is if they are unfamiliar with the loch.
**Surface** River Calder | All Water Users |  Bruises and broken bones up to concussion and neck injury. Drowning  |  Educate around how shallow the mouth of the river calder is. Highlight that treee branches and other hazards are washed down it and may cause submerged hazards. Zone to avoid but mandate kneeling if forced to cross this area (usually to avoid strong SW winds).

## Risks - Dynamic


Hazard | Who | Severity & Consequences (Potential) | ControlMeasure
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Surface**  |  |  |  
**Hazards**  |  |  |  
**Others** Sailors | All water users | Collision | Educate around likely areas of meeting sailors and zone to avoid this. Sailors will congregate around route marking buoys and this is an example of a location to avoid.  
**Others** Rowers |  All water users| High speed collision |  Educate around the high speed that rowers travel. Highlight that they are looking backwards and have very limited steering ability. Zone to avoid rowing course or training lanes where possible. If forced to cross, then do so in a managed group, that is under close supervision by lead instructor.
**Others** Kayakers | All water users |  |  
**Others** MotorBoats | All water users |  |  
**Others** SUP boarders | All water users |  |
