title: Risk Assesment
category: SUP Safety Management System
order: 20
---

## Types of Risk
- Generic (always the same)
- Site Specific (specific to the location)
- Dynamic (need to be assessed on the day and continuously during the activity)

and these can be
- Qualitative (Enough, Too much etc...)
- Quantitative (Numbers, limits etc...)

## Risk - Generic

Hazard | Who | Severity & Consequences (Potential) | ControlMeasure
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Hazard** Slip on Waterside environment | All | Bruises and broken bones up to concussion and neck injury | Educate participants about slip hazard and mandate suitable footwear or bare feet
**Hazard** Slips, Trips & Falls on route to water  | All | Bruises and broken bones up to concussion and neck injury |  Educate users on Trip Hazards as well as the safe way to carry SUP and Paddle. Highlight the length of SUP's and how to avoid hitting things when navigating with them on land.
**Hazard** Equipment failure  | All | Low initial severity if caught quickly. Raising severity if unresolved.  | All Kit checked prior to session (SOP Procedure) with a spare paddle carried by Instructor to meet most common equipment failure.

## Risks - Lochwinnoch (Castle Semple Loch: Main Site)
The Loch is quite a safe environment with most risks coming from shore hazards, wind and other water users.

Hazard | Who | Severity & Consequences (Potential) | ControlMeasure
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Surface** Access road has stones that may injure soles of feet.  | All | Bruised feet. | Educate and recommend footwear to avoid injury
**Surface** Floating Marker Buoys, Logs, vegetation and Fishing lines may all cause collision/entanglement hazards.  | All water users | Falling from board or leash entanglement. Potential for drowning |  Educate water users but also use zoning to minimise time near known hazards. Ensure thhey understand how Leash Quick Release operates.
**Surface** Pontoons | All |  Bruises and broken bones up to concussion and neck injury  |  Educate around how slippy the pontoons can be when wet and covered in bird droppings. Ban running on them. Educate about concussion hazard if standing on board within two board lengths of teh pontoons. Mandate kneeling within this distance.
**Surface** Wooden loch siding  | All |  Bruises and broken bones up to concussion and neck injury   |  Educate around how VERY slippy the wood is along the lochside path at the car park. Mandate kneeling within two board lengths of the lochside
**Surface** Submerged lochside path | All Water Users |  Bruises and broken bones up to concussion and neck injury  |  Educate water users that the path is often submerged an d forms a submerged trip hazard. Mandate they are kneeling if within two board lengths of the **normal** lochside. Educate as to where this is if they are unfamiliar with the loch.
**Surface** River Calder | All Water Users |  Bruises and broken bones up to concussion and neck injury. Drowning  |  Educate around how shallow the mouth of the river calder is. Highlight that treee branches and other hazards are washed down it and may cause submerged hazards. Zone to avoid but mandate kneeling if forced to cross this area (usually to avoid strong SW winds).
**Others** Rowers, Sailors, Kayakers, Powerboats and other SUP users | All water users | Low likelihood of collission |  These users normally follow preictable patterns and can be avoided with simple zoning and awareness given in on shore briefing (See Dynamic Risks)

## Risks - Dynamic


Hazard | Who | Severity & Consequences (Potential) | ControlMeasure
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Surface** Wind chop | All water users | Winds may raise small sharp waves (wind chop) that make it difficuklt for students to stand on their boards. This raises a falling hazard with a small potential for injury or Drowning | Ensure that Wind Chop is constantly monitored with a preference for going directly into or away from it. This removes the rolling momenbt that causes most students to fall.  
**Hazards**  |  |  |  
**Others** Sailors | All water users | Collision | Educate around likely areas of meeting sailors and zone to avoid this. Sailors will congregate around route marking buoys and this is an example of a location to avoid.  
**Others** Rowers |  All water users| High speed collision |  Educate around the high speed that rowers travel. Highlight that they are looking backwards and have very limited steering ability. Zone to avoid rowing course or training lanes where possible. If forced to cross, then do so in a managed group, that is under close supervision by lead instructor.
**Others** Kayakers | All water users | Low severity of impact | Kayakers rarely pose a hazard to SUP students but they do need to be tracked near dusk as they are low to the water and easy to miss.  
**Others** MotorBoats | All water users | Severe impact but low likelihood | The only motorboats on the loch are rescue, training and coaching boats. They follow predictable patterns. Ensure that all instructors understand these patterns. Highlight any relevant motorboat patterns to students.    
**Others** SUP boarders | All water users | Low chance of collision | Ensure that SUPO boarders stay at least two board lengths apart at all times.
**Environment** Unexpectedly poor weather  | All | Low initial severity if caught quickly. Raising severity if unresolved.  |  Instructor to maintaina constant watch on weather conditions and curtail the session before it becomes a problem. Make students aware in onshore demo that this may happen.
