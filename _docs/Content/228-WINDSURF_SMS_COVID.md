- The school is now in a **Tier 4 Area **. Only people from within that Tier 4 Area can attend sessions.

# COVID Measures

Despite the great news regarding COVID we still must operate with COVID preventative measures and restrictions in place, and as the new season approaches I want to remind you what these are:

Independent sailing and SUPing are permitted.

## Arival & Departure

- Parents must not come to the compound whilst dropping off, or collecting their children
- No Parents can park at the compound at any time
- Parents/family should not congregate near the compound, or at any of the access paths, slipway or pontoons that may be used during the session.

## Compound :

- Hand disinfect, when you: 
  - Enter the compound
  - Especially if you are going to:  
    - Touch the gate
    - Accept or Return club kit
    - Touch any club kit 
- You must be a club member.
- You must book a slot before you come to the club.
- There is a limit on the session numbers. **You must have a slot booked before attending.**
- 2m distancing at all times.
- Use your own equipment only, unless prior arrangement has been made with the Session Coach.
- If equipment is required fro the compound the the session coach may assign a volunteer as the "Compound Manager"
- If a "Coached Session" offers the use of club kit, then it will be layed out for you by the Coach or Compound Manager before hand. They will handle delivery and recovery of any club kit. <br />**No parents or volunteers can assist with this or the safety boat preparation.**
- All club storage areas, are not accessible to participants.
- Be cautious at all times on and off the water.

## Safety Boats
The safety benefit of the RIB is very much greater than the COVID risk from operating the RIB providing the precautions are followed:

- RIBs can only be operated by the session coach and assistant.
- All RIB operations to follow these rules, during launching and recovery:
- Where possible, members of the same household to launch and recover boats (Session Coach and Assistant)
- All helpers must wear a face covering.
- All helpers must stay 2m apart - use ropes to pull the trolley and the boat if required
- Clean all surfaces post useage
- We all need to understand and follow these precautions so that we can help everyone stay safe.

## On the water
- The only personal contact will be
    - Session Coach in a rescue/medical situation

The measures above will hopefully be relaxed as soon as government restrictions allow.
