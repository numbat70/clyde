## SOP (Standard Operating Procedures)
These are the procedures that are followed by all Instructors that will ensure the safety of all participants. 

## EAP (Emergency Action Plan)
This is a functional document that defines what to do in case of an emergency, and also the relevant information, that will help you in these situations.

- EAP (Lochwinnoch - SUP)
